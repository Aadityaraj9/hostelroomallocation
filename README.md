The hostel room allocation system is a Java-based application designed to streamline the
process of assigning living accommodations to students in a hostel environment. As the demand
for student housing continues to rise, effective management of room allocation becomes crucial
to ensure a smooth and organized experience for both students and administration. This project
utilizes PostgreSQL as its database management system, comprising six meticulously designed
tables that facilitate the storage and retrieval of essential data, including student registration
numbers and room types. 
 
The system allows registered students to log in and select their desired accommodation based
on availability. By categorizing rooms into 1-seater, 2-seater, 3-seater, and 4-seater types, the
application offers flexibility and convenience, catering to various student needs. A notable
feature of the system is its visual representation of room availability, which uses intuitive icons
to indicate the status of each room. Filled rooms are clearly marked in red, providing instant
feedback to users regarding their booking options. 
 
The user interface is built using Java Swing, providing a robust and responsive graphical
interface that enhances user experience. Swing components facilitate easy navigation and
interaction, making the application accessible to students with varying levels of technical
proficiency. In addition to the straightforward booking process, the system incorporates robust
mechanisms for handling potential issues, such as overbooking and room unavailability. By
ensuring that only registered students can access the booking functionality, the application
maintains security and data integrity. 
 
Overall, this hostel room allocation system not only simplifies the room booking process but
also serves as a model for future enhancements in student housing management. With potential
improvements in scalability and integration with other campus services, this project paves the
way for more efficient hostel administration and improved student satisfaction.
